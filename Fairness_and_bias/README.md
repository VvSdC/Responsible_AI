## Fairness and Bias

Fairness and bias are important to make sure AI systems do not create or increase unfair treatment or discrimination. It is necessary to build and use algorithms that give fair results to everyone, no matter their background or personal traits.

- Fairness and bias mean making sure AI systems work in a fair and unbiased way.
- This includes reducing any unfair or biased results that can happen because of biased training data or unfair algorithms.
