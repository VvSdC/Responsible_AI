## 🗽 New York City Bias Audit Law

The **New York City Bias Audit Law** (Local Law 144) sets clear requirements for employers to ensure fairness in automated employment decision systems.

### 🔍 What is a Bias Audit?

- A **bias audit** is an evaluation of an automated employment decision system to detect and address any biases in how it works.
- It must be conducted by an independent third-party auditor.
- The audit examines the system’s algorithms, input data, and decision-making processes to ensure results are fair and unbiased.

### 🏢 Who Must Comply?

- The law applies to **all employers** operating in New York City — regardless of their size, industry, or revenue.
- Every employer must carry out a bias audit of any automated tools used in hiring, promotion, or retention decisions.
- Non-compliance can lead to fines and penalties imposed by the NYC Commission on Human Rights.

### 🤖 What is an AEDT?

- An **Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT)** is defined as any system that uses:
  - Machine learning
  - Statistical modeling
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Data analytics

  to produce simplified outputs (scores, categories, recommendations) that significantly influence employment decisions like hiring or promotion.

- **Important:**  
  Not all tools are AEDTs. Tools that don’t meaningfully automate or support employment decisions (e.g., spam filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators) are **not** covered by this law.

### ⚠️ Violators vs. Defaults

- The law distinguishes between **violations** and **defaults**, each carrying different penalties.
- Employers who fail to comply may face fines or other enforcement actions by the city.
