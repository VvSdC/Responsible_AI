## 🇺🇸 NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

The **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)** provides guidance for organizations to manage AI-specific risks while fostering trust and innovation.

### 🗂️ Definitions of Risk

- **Prohibited or Unacceptable Risk**  
  AI systems posing a clear threat to people’s safety, rights, or livelihoods — such as social scoring by governments or toys encouraging dangerous behavior — are banned.

- **High Risk**  
  AI systems that could endanger lives or health, such as those used in critical infrastructure (e.g., autonomous vehicles).

- **Limited or Medium Risk**  
  AI systems with transparency obligations, like chatbots, where users should know they are interacting with AI so they can make informed choices.

- **Low or Minimal Risk**  
  Systems like AI-enabled spam filters — most current AI applications fall into this category.

### 🧩 What is the AI RMF?

- Defines an **AI system** as any machine-based system that produces outputs — predictions, recommendations, or decisions — that impact real or virtual environments, based on human-defined objectives.
- Helps organizations understand how their AI systems may affect individuals, groups, and communities.

---

### 🎯 Purpose

- Build trust, manage risks, protect civil liberties, enhance safety, and foster innovation.
- Provides a flexible, adaptable process to address AI-specific risks in diverse contexts.
- **Not a compliance tool**, but a guide for governance and best practices.
- Supports alignment with existing laws and regulations without replacing them.
- Applies across the entire AI lifecycle and adapts to new information and contexts.
- Developed by NIST to align with national AI strategies.

### ⚙️ Core Functions

The AI RMF Core consists of **four key functions** to guide risk management:

1️⃣ **Govern**  
   - Establish and maintain a culture of risk management.  
   - Build governance structures and clear processes for AI oversight.

2️⃣ **Map**  
   - Identify and understand the context of AI systems.  
   - Recognize and assess risks linked to those contexts.

3️⃣ **Measure**  
   - Evaluate, track, and analyze identified risks.  
   - Ensure systems perform as intended and align with risk objectives.

4️⃣ **Manage**  
   - Prioritize and address risks based on their potential impact.  
   - Implement strategies to mitigate and manage risks over time.

Each function is broken down into categories, subcategories, and actionable steps for organizations to follow.
