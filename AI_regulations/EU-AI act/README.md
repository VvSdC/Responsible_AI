## 🇪🇺 The European Union AI Act

The **European Union AI Act** is part of the EU’s digital strategy to foster safe and trustworthy AI. As a political and economic union of 27 member states, the EU aims to set global standards for AI regulation and governance.

### 🎯 Purpose

- The EU introduced the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework for AI, classifying systems by risk to determine the level of control needed.
- This marks a major milestone in AI governance, promoting the safe, transparent, traceable, non-discriminatory, and environmentally sustainable use of AI.
- The Act emphasizes human oversight to reduce the risk of automated harm and sets a consistent, technology-neutral definition of AI for current and future systems.

### 🗂️ Different Rules for Different Risk Levels

The AI Act defines clear responsibilities for AI **providers** and **users**, depending on the system’s level of risk.

---

#### 🚫 **Unacceptable Risk**

These AI systems are banned outright because they pose clear threats to people’s rights and safety:

- AI that manipulates cognitive behavior in harmful ways — e.g., voice-activated toys that encourage dangerous actions.
- Systems that exploit vulnerabilities of certain groups (e.g., based on age or disability) to distort their behavior.
- Social scoring — rating people’s trustworthiness or worth based on their behavior, socio-economic status, or personal traits.
- Large-scale, untargeted facial image scraping from the internet to build facial recognition databases.
- AI that assesses a person’s risk of committing a crime purely through profiling or by analyzing personality traits.
- Emotion recognition AI in workplaces and schools — unless used for valid medical or safety reasons.

#### ⚠️ **High Risk**

High-risk AI systems are those with the potential to negatively affect safety or fundamental rights. They are grouped into two main categories:

1️⃣ **Products Covered by EU Product Safety Laws**  
These are AI systems used in products regulated under existing EU safety legislation, such as:
- Toys
- Aviation equipment
- Automobiles
- Medical devices
- Elevators

2️⃣ **AI Systems in Sensitive Domains**  
These systems must be registered in an EU database and include:
- Biometric identification and categorization of individuals
- Management and operation of critical infrastructure
- Education and vocational training
- Employment, workforce management, and access to self-employment
- Law enforcement applications
- Access to essential private services, public services, and social benefits
- Management of migration, asylum, and border control
- Administration of justice and democratic processes

✅ **Mandatory Assessment:**  
All high-risk AI systems must undergo strict conformity assessments before being placed on the market. They must also be monitored and re-assessed regularly throughout their lifecycle to maintain compliance.
