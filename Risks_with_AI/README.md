## Risks of Using Generative AI

Generative AI — such as models like GPT or Stable Diffusion — stands apart from traditional machine learning. Instead of picking from pre-defined choices, it can create text, images, and code entirely from scratch. These models are trained on huge datasets, sometimes with hundreds of billions of words or images.

However, the way these models are built and used brings several risks. Below are the key challenges that organizations need to consider:

---

### 1. Unpredictable Output Quality

Generative AI doesn't always stick to the rules. It can produce brilliant content or generate something completely off-brand — or worse, offensive. Because these models don’t understand tone, culture, or context, human review is essential to avoid inappropriate results.

---

### 2. Hallucinated or False Information

Even advanced models can “hallucinate,” meaning they make things up. This could be a small error (like getting a date wrong) or something serious, such as falsely accusing someone. When used in high-risk environments like healthcare, law, or customer service, these mistakes can have real-world consequences.

---

### 3. Legal and Copyright Issues

Generative models may unknowingly use or recreate copyrighted material. If training data includes private or protected content, this can lead to lawsuits or data privacy violations. For example, using code from a private repository or generating copyrighted artwork could cause legal trouble.

---

### 4. Built-in Biases

Since these models learn from public data, they can pick up and repeat biases. Asking for an image of a CEO might mostly return white males. This isn’t just a technical flaw — it reflects societal imbalance and can reinforce stereotypes in harmful ways.

---

### 5. Easy to Misuse

Generative AI can be exploited by users who deliberately try to break its rules (a process called “jailbreaking”). A chatbot meant for support could be tricked into giving offensive advice or revealing private details. These vulnerabilities can appear soon after launch if not properly tested.

---

### 6. High Cost and Limited Talent

Building reliable generative AI systems isn’t cheap. It requires massive computing power and deep technical knowledge — resources that only a few big tech companies currently have. Smaller companies may struggle to access the skills and infrastructure needed.

## Broader Harms from AI Technology

Beyond generative models, AI in general brings its own set of dangers:

---

### Deepfakes and Identity Fraud

AI-generated videos and voices can be used to impersonate people, spread false information, or steal identities. This poses risks to individuals and organizations alike.

---

### AI-Assisted Cybercrime

Hackers can use AI to write smarter phishing emails, break into systems more efficiently, or automate attacks at scale. This makes cyber threats harder to detect and more dangerous.

---

### Privacy in Virtual Assistants

As AI becomes embedded in phones, homes, and workplaces, assistants may collect sensitive data. If not properly secured, this information could be misused or leaked.

---

### Final Note

These risks make it clear: as AI advances, safety, fairness, and accountability must keep up. Organizations need strong security, clear policies, and responsible development practices to reduce harm and earn user trust.
