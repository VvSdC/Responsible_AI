# 📘 Who Is Responsible in the AI Lifecycle?

Building a responsible AI system is not the job of a single person or team — it involves many stakeholders working together at different stages of the AI lifecycle. Each stage has its own goals, risks, and responsibilities.

This guide breaks down each phase of the lifecycle, who is responsible, and the key questions they need to address.

---

## 1️⃣ Origination

**🧑‍💼 Responsible Role:** Business Sponsor (Product Owner, Business Lead, or AI Initiative Owner)

**🎯 Goal:** Define the *purpose* of the AI system and ensure it solves a real business or societal problem ethically.

**✅ Key Responsibilities:**
- Clearly define what the AI system is meant to do.
- Make sure the goal aligns with user needs and organizational values.
- Consider ethical implications before development starts.

**❓ Critical Question:**  
*How do I ensure the intended purpose of this model is well-defined and ethical?*

---

## 2️⃣ Model Development

**👩‍🔬 Responsible Role:** Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer

**🎯 Goal:** Build and train the AI model using data.

**✅ Key Responsibilities:**
- Select high-quality, diverse, and representative datasets.
- Ensure the model is technically sound and privacy-compliant.
- Document how the model is built, including its features and logic.

**❓ Critical Question:**  
*Do the data sources and modeling choices meet privacy regulations and fairness expectations?*

---

## 3️⃣ Model Validation

**🔍 Responsible Role:** Model Validation / Risk / QA Team

**🎯 Goal:** Independently assess the model to check for fairness, robustness, and bias.

**✅ Key Responsibilities:**
- Evaluate model performance on various subgroups.
- Identify and mitigate bias, overfitting, or inappropriate assumptions.
- Perform stress testing and adversarial testing.

**❓ Critical Question:**  
*How do we ensure the model is not inherently biased or unfair to any group?*

---

## 4️⃣ Model Compliance

**📜 Responsible Role:** Compliance / Legal / Risk Governance Team

**🎯 Goal:** Ensure the AI system adheres to legal and regulatory standards.

**✅ Key Responsibilities:**
- Review model transparency and documentation.
- Check if decisions are explainable to regulators and auditors.
- Ensure the use of AI aligns with privacy, discrimination, and data-use laws.

**❓ Critical Question:**  
*Can we explain how this model works to a regulatory body in a clear, defensible way?*

---

## 5️⃣ Model Approval

**🏢 Responsible Role:** Business Operations / Executive Stakeholders

**🎯 Goal:** Approve the model for launch based on business impact and regulatory review.

**✅ Key Responsibilities:**
- Balance model performance with legal, ethical, and operational concerns.
- Ensure the model delivers value without compromising compliance or trust.

**❓ Critical Question:**  
*How do we ensure model accuracy aligns with compliance and ethical expectations?*

---

## 6️⃣ Deployment

**🖥️ Responsible Role:** IT / MLOps / Engineering Team

**🎯 Goal:** Deploy the model to production in a secure, stable, and repeatable way.

**✅ Key Responsibilities:**
- Set up version control and deployment pipelines.
- Make sure the model performs as expected across environments.
- Ensure reproducibility and rollback mechanisms are in place.

**❓ Critical Question:**  
*How do we ensure reproducibility and stability across model versions and updates?*

---

## 7️⃣ Production Monitoring

**⚙️ Responsible Role:** Operations / Monitoring / MLOps Team

**🎯 Goal:** Monitor the live system for errors, drift, and misuse.

**✅ Key Responsibilities:**
- Track model accuracy over time (concept/data drift).
- Detect changes in input data, behavior, or performance.
- Trigger retraining or alert when performance degrades.

**❓ Critical Question:**  
*How do we monitor for data drift, performance drops, or misuse of the AI model in production?*
